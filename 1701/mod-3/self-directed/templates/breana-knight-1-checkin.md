#### Project Pitch  
  - The software is designed to create an interactive experience for the audience and performer. The software visualizes the audiences interaction with the music to render a visual display of the live performance.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
  - React
  - Redux
  - Router?
  - P5.js
  - Abelton

#### APIs:  
Links to any API docs that you have decided to use

#### Wireframes  
  - Wireframes have been drawn by hand. There is very little to be shown for the software environment in it's static state.
#### Waffle.io

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
  1. Environment set-up
  2. Sketching using Environment
  3. Sketch triggered on a key input
  4. Sketch triggered by a camera
  5. Sketch triggered by music
  6. Sketch triggered by a more precise data captured by camera
  7. Sketch triggered by a particular frequency
  8. Sketch triggering multiple visual renderings based on camera data
  9. Sketch triggering multiple visual renderings based on music input
  10. Further customization of visual renderings

#### MVP
  - Video capture that is able to render a different color based on a physical movement.

#### Nice To Haves   
  - Video capture is able to render shapes, multiple color patterns based on movement and music.

#### Biggest Challenges  
  - Capturing the data from the camera
  - Gaining familiarity and focus with p5

    -   Coding Train p5.js tutorials
    -   Personal Interaction w/Creative Developers on the topic
